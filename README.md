# AlgebraOfInference

[![Build Status](https://github.com/yl4070/AlgebraOfInference.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/yl4070/AlgebraOfInference.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


> In early developments!


Provide unified algebra like syntax for hypthosis testing, inspired by `AlgebraOfGraphics` and R package `infer`. 

The goal of the package is to provide a new interface to `HypothersisTest.jl` and also a wrapper of testings from R via `RCall.jl`. 


## Features

+ `@formula` expression support
+ composable testing constructions
